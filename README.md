This repository is a documentation of my usage of Tensor Network Matrix Product States in Optimisation of Quantum Variable Algorithms

The focus is the usage of NVIDIA's CUDA-Q library utilising GPU power

Contents:

1. Comparison of GPU vs CPU runtime in QAOA (Quantum Approximate Optimisation Algorithm) when applied to the Max-Cut problem.
